## General Requirements
* GPU must be capable of OpenGL 3.1+
* A Freelancer installation (Vanilla recommended, some mods may work)

## Build Instructions

Note for developers: .\build.ps1 or build.sh _must_ be ran before opening the .sln file, as it generates required files for the solution.

### Windows
**Prerequisites:**

* 64-bit Windows 10 or newer
* Visual Studio 2022 with:
* * .NET 8.0 SDK
* *  Desktop C++ Development Workflow
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository with all submodules (Visual Studio's Team Explorer, Git bash, etc.)
2. Run `build.ps1` in Powershell. (Can be launched from cmd by `powershell -File .\build.ps1`)

**Troubleshooting**:

If you run into issues with Powershell execution policies, you can bypass them with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1`

If you have installed both the 32-bit and 64-bit dotnet SDKs, your PATH can be in an invalid state and the build will fail.
This can be checked with `where dotnet.exe` in the command prompt. If it returns output like:

```
> where.exe dotnet
C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\dotnet.exe
C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe
```

You need to either uninstall the 32-bit dotnet SDK (recommended), or modify your PATH so the 64-bit SDK appears first in the list.

### Linux

**Prerequisites:**

* .NET 8.0 SDK
* SDL2
* openal-soft
* gcc and g++
* CMake
* GTK3, Pango and Cairo headers


**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Librelancer/Librelancer`
2. Run `build.sh`

**Troubleshooting:**

`Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets(84,5): Error  : Unhandled exception. Interop+Crypto+OpenSslCryptographicException: error:03000098:digital envelope routines::invalid digest` on Fedora/RHEL:

RedHat has disabled RSA+SHA1 signatures in OpenSSL with a vendor patch, breaking strong name signatures in dotnet.

If you are using `./build.sh`, run the command as `OPENSSL_ENABLE_SHA1_SIGNATURES=1 ./build.sh` to work around this safely. 

For developers, noting that this is **not recommended** by RedHat, you can follow instructions from RedHat to re-enable SHA1 signatures system-wide: https://docs.redhat.com/fr/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/proc_re-enabling-sha-1_using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies


### Nix

If you are using the Nix package manager, you can use the provided shell script to easily acquire all the packages. You can do so by running the `nix-shell --pure` command then running `./build.sh`.
